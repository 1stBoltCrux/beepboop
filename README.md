## _Behavior Driven Development Breakdown_

* _1. Program replaces 0 with "Beep"
input: 0
output "Beep"_
* _2. Program replaces 1 with "Boop"
input: 1
output: "Boop"_
* _3. Program identifies a string or number containing 0 and replaces with "Beep"
input: 123450
output: "Beep"_
* _4. Numbers divisible by three will be replaced with "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that."
input: 9
output: "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that."_
* _5. Program should determine which action to take on a number with both 1's, 0's and numbers divisible by 3 in an order of importance.
input: 30
output "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that."_
* _6. Program will display user input with 1's replaced with "Boop" and 0's replaced with "Beep" and all numbers divisible by 3 replaced with "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that."
